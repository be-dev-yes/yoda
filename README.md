# Yoda

The current state of this is a work in progress, but to have something to inform you, just be aware of the following statements regarding our approach to teach concepts to be a developer:

- We follow the market, thus the reality as it is.
- Every project must have a set of business rules and tests to guarantee its purpose is somewhat fulfilled. I mean "somewhat" because you won't always have the time for it.
- Be declarative during your development.
- If you know how to google, you may know most of what is needed to do everything in development.
- Suppose you know tests (unit, integration, and functional). In that case, you may gain lots of time to do more things, improving your development skills.
- You do not need college, courses, or certification to be a developer; you must only solve problems. If you can prove it (see the topic below), then the market will hire you, no matter what.
- Constantly improve your programming knowledge, even after you know the basics above.
