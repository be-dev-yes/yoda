# Yoda

The current state of this is *work in progress*, but in order to have something to inform you, just be aware of the following statements regarding our approach to teach concepts to be developer:

- We follow the market, thus the reality as it is
- Every project must have a set of business rules and tests to guarantee that its purpose is somewhat fulfilled, I mean "somewhat" because not always you'll have the time for it
- Be declarative during your development
- If you know how to google, then you may know most of what is needed to do everything in development
- If you know tests (unit, integration and functional) you may gain lots of time to do more things, improving your development skills
- You do not need college, course or certification to be a developer, you must only solve problems. If you can prove it (see the topic below), then the market will hire you, no matter what
- Always improve your knowledge about programming, even after you know the basics above
